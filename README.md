# Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario
Discover how to predict the inquiries that your business leaders will require answers for.

# Context and Background:

You have been engaged as a consultant by an online retail store to assess their data and offer valuable insights to the CEO and CMO. The company has been achieving strong results, and the management seeks to understand the primary drivers behind their revenue, aiming to strategically plan for the coming year.

The leadership is keen on examining metrics from both operational and marketing angles. Additionally, they have expansion plans and are looking for guidance on areas of strength to maintain focus on what works. They are also interested in dissecting various metrics based on the available demographic information in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO is scheduled for next month, and your task is to draft pertinent analytics and insights that will aid in evaluating the current business performance and recommending metrics to facilitate their expansion decision.

Always keep in mind that adopting a business leader's perspective will enhance your data analysis and the presentation of insightful findings.

Refer to the provided resources below to gain a deeper understanding of how business leaders think and approach business performance.

# Details for task
In preparation for your upcoming meeting, it's essential to formulate a series of questions that you believe will hold significance and pertinence to both the CEO and CMO. This preparatory step will serve as your roadmap while you construct your presentation.

For this particular assignment, your sole task is to draft these questions. Be sure to consider a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative aspects.

In the provided resources, you have access to a dataset that will serve as the foundation for your exploration. Examine this dataset, paying attention to the information it contains, the insights that can be gleaned, and what is specifically pertinent to the CEO and CMO, respectively.

Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each of the business leaders will pose and seek answers to. Ensure that your questions are distinctive, as the CEO and CMO approach business decisions from different perspectives.

Eight (8) questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO) 

# Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals
Discover which visuals are most effective in a given scenario.

# Context and Background:
The CEO and CMO have tasked you with creating visualizations for the metrics they wish to assess in the context of the online retail store. Your role involves gathering their requirements and suggesting the most suitable visualizations for the given scenarios. Senior management is keen to gain insights into the company's performance and identify its core strengths. Furthermore, they are committed to pinpointing growth opportunities that will drive future revenue generation.

You will receive multiple visualization requests from the CEO, and your responsibility is to provide visuals that simplify the data and insights as much as possible. These visuals should effectively convey the intended information. This exercise holds significant importance for senior management, as any inaccurate representation could result in a miscommunication of the data or lead to incorrect decision-making. Hence, it is imperative to ensure that the right visuals are chosen for each dataset.

# Details for task
For this task, your primary objective is to carefully read and comprehend the questions, taking into account the specific business requirements. Once you have a clear understanding of what the CEO and CMO are seeking, your task is to devise the optimal visual representation that effectively communicates what the senior managers are looking for in each given situation. It's important to keep in mind that data can be portrayed using various types of charts, but your role is to choose the visualization that best conveys the presented information.

You will have access to resources that guide you on how to select appropriate visuals for different scenarios, which can be found in the provided resources section. These resources will assist you in determining which visual to employ for a given business scenario and will also provide guidance on selecting the right chart or graph for your dataset. Each question will present a distinct scenario, and your responses should be tailored to that particular context.

To complete this task, answer the multiple-choice quiz. Start the quiz by clicking 'Click here to start the task' in section 5 below. Please note there are 5 multiple choice questions to complete in this task. Please be patient as each question loads.

# Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals
Utilize your knowledge and generate visual representations in accordance with the business scenarios.

# Context and Background:
The CEO and CMO recently convened to finalize their needs and are looking to you to supply them with analyses and visual materials that can address their inquiries. Both of these executives are keen on exploring how they can leverage the data to make more informed decisions. Your task is to provide insights that can aid in crafting an expansion strategy. The executives aim to scrutinize trends and categorize data, enhancing their understanding of how revenue is generated and identifying the primary factors influencing the online store.

You will receive specific requirements from the executives regarding how they wish to interpret the data. Following the data requirement gathering phase, it is crucial to ensure that the data you are working with is of high quality, free from any erroneous information that could adversely affect your analysis. Once the data is cleansed, the subsequent step involves creating visual representations, whether in Tableau or Power BI. Regardless of the visualization tool chosen, the ultimate goal is to deliver results that will empower the executives in making well-informed decisions and supporting their expansion strategy.

# Details for task
For this task, your objective is to design visual representations for four of the questions specified by the CEO and CMO. You have the option to utilize either Tableau or Power BI for crafting these visuals, and the necessary data is available in the provided resources. Both Tableau and Power BI offer free trial versions that you can access to complete this task. Instructions on how to obtain these free trials are available in the resource provided below.

# Data cleanup
Prior to commencing the analysis, it is crucial to ensure the data is properly cleansed. You may have observed that the data includes instances of returns to the store, denoted by negative quantities, and there are unit prices that were erroneously entered. To rectify this, follow the steps outlined below:

• Create a check that the quantity should not be below 1 unit

• Create a check that the Unit price should not be below $0

To apply these checks, employ conditional formulas where the logic dictates that if the conditions are met, the tool should exclude the data from the analysis. Alternatively, you can utilize data transformation techniques to eliminate the problematic data. Both of these methods are elaborated in the resources section. Once this cleansing process is completed, the data will be suitable for further analysis. It's essential to emphasize that data should be cleaned before addressing any questions.

For creating each visual, designate a separate tab with the tab name corresponding to the question number. After crafting the visuals, save the files and upload them as follows: Tableau users should upload files in .twbx format, while Power BI files should be saved in .pbix format. Detailed instructions on how to save in these formats can be found in the resources section.

# If you encounter any difficulties, please refer to the Visuals Hints document available in the resources for guidance.

# Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

# Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

# Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

# Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

# Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis
Effectively convey your discoveries and elucidate their relevance to each respective scenario.

# Context and Background:
It is time to deliver your findings to the CEO and CMO. They are eager to grasp your reasoning and how you managed the data cleansing and visualization stages. It's crucial to articulate your thought process and concepts in a concise and transparent manner. Additionally, you need to provide a clear presentation of the analysis for all four questions from the preceding task. Ensure that you have a comprehensive understanding of the data and the insights you've drawn from your analysis.

Expansion is a foremost concern for these leaders, and they are particularly interested in pinpointing the most promising opportunities within their business.

# Details for task

Develop a script and record a video presenting your findings to the CEO and CMO based on the four questions they asked and the visuals you created in the previous tasks.

You can use your work or the model answer from the previous task to develop your presentation.

When writing your script, you should speak about your entire process, including the initial data load and clean-up steps so that your leaders know you have done your due diligence in providing error-free analysis. Data analysis provides heaps of information but remember to focus on the information that is most important to your leaders.

Your video should be approximately 5 minutes in length. You can record your video in the browser or upload a video from your device below.

Remember, this is not just a read out of your visuals, you’re presenting to the CEO and CMO and need to provide context for each scenario and how it relates to their questioning.
